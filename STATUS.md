# NAS-tools Status

**Current state:** M0 substrate built. `nas-core`, `nas-crypto` and `nas-store`
are green; the M0 padding measurement is done and **contradicted the spec**.
Remaining for M0: `nas-cli` + the `nas test` substrate.

`SPECS.md` is at **revision 5** (~1476 lines, 21 sections). It has survived one
adversarial review (rev 1→2, 15 findings, all accepted), a round closing its own
open questions (rev 2→3), and rev 4 adds confidentiality modes, the git face,
permissions/ACLs, Object Lock, DVC, formal methods and a use-case cookbook.
Revision 4 was reviewed and revision 5 closed all six blockers it found.

## Decided

Untrusted peers; Rust; PQC throughout (ML-DSA-65 / hybrid ML-KEM-768 /
XChaCha20-Poly1305 / BLAKE3); localhost daemon as the trust boundary; convergent
encryption with a per-tenant secret; deterministic size-class padding; local
listing; lease-based GC with deltas; **three confidentiality modes** (`e2ee`,
`passphrase`, `transit-only`); `cas-merge` slots for S3, docs and git refs
(fast-forward merge for refs); read-only mount via WebDAV first.

## Shipped

- **`../simple-network` protocol v1** — handshake transcript binding + constant-time
  pin comparison. 15 tests green, clippy clean, fmt clean. Wire-breaking by design;
  v0 peers are refused with an explicit version error rather than downgraded.
- **`formal/lean/NasVerify/Transcript.lean`** — VERIFIED under Lean 4.28. Three
  theorems, zero `sorry`: decoder round-trip, encoding injectivity, padding
  reversibility.

- **`formal/tlaplus/SlotConsistency.tla`** — MODEL-CHECKED. 38,709 distinct states
  at MaxSeq=2 (CI gate), 4,699,837 at MaxSeq=3 (deep gate). Its first revision
  failed TLC in 7 states, catching three defects; see `formal/README.md`.
- **`crates/nas-core`** — canonical encoder with proptests mirroring the Lean
  theorems, plus `Addr`, the `Clock` trait and the format discriminants.
  15 tests green.
- **`crates/nas-crypto`** — the §3.1 key schedule. `NoncePolicy` is private and
  `Key` has no constructor that accepts one, so a deterministic nonce on a
  non-content-derived key is unrepresentable. `ChunkReadKey` lets a stored `ck`
  decrypt without being able to seal — the manifest needs the round trip, and
  making the reconstructed key *open-only* is what keeps it from becoming a
  nonce-reuse hole. All twelve signature contexts. 16 tests green.
- **`crates/nas-store`** — FastCDC (gear table in-repo and golden-pinned, because
  it is a format constant), checked size-class padding, the blob store with
  proof-of-possession, manifests, and the object write/read pipeline.
  **56 tests green.**
- **`tests/usecases/`** — 83 acceptance assertions, milestone-gated; 53 are M0–M2.

## Measured, not assumed

- **Padding overhead (M0 exit criterion).** SPECS §4.2.1 estimated 20–35%.
  Measured on two real corpora: **+56%** on large files, **+97%** on a source
  tree. The estimate was off by 2–3× and SPECS has been corrected (rev 6). A ×2
  ladder costs ~1.5× on any distribution, and small files pay the 32 KiB floor
  regardless of tuning — overhead scales with *file count*.
- **Streaming is real.** 5.5 MiB peak RSS while writing 631 MB; 8.6 MiB across
  12904 files. Memory tracks the chunker window, not file size.
- **Dedup works.** 54.1% recovered on a corpus of split binaries without being
  told the files were related; `fixed` managed only 16.2% on the same data.

See `MANUAL-TESTING.md` §5 for the commands and raw output.

## Not built

M0 step 4 (`nas-cli` + the `nas test` substrate). `ci.sh` is green end to end
today: 87 Rust tests, Lean verified, TLC green with its three sanity checks
still failing as required.

## Environment constraints

16 GB RAM on the dev machine. Docker 29.3 (desktop-linux), colima 0.10.1, lima
2.1.0 available. The multi-node simulation must build on the host and run slim
runtime containers — a `cargo` toolchain inside each node would not fit.

See `TODO.md`.
